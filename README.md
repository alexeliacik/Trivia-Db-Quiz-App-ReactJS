<h1 style='text-align:center;'> Trivia Db Quiz App - React JS </h1>

<strong> In this project, I used the most updated React Js futures with Styled Components; I used React Transition Group to animate when to mount or unmount something from DOM. I took data from THE MOVIE DATABASE API and showed users different data in different situations with beautiful animations.  The project has a responsive design for all devices. </strong>

<strong> Let's start with the first animation. I really like to play with animations. I did not use any CSS library. I know how they can make slow big applications. My first animation appears once per minute. I didn't want to show the user when they visit the home page every time. One minute still not too much, but of course, I can determine the time. Now see the picture below.  </strong>

<h2>CSS</h2>

<strong> For design I used 'font-size: 62.5%' technic. Because it is effortless to use and make your design responsive. Now see the picture below. </strong>

<h2>JAVASCRIPT</h2>

<strong> For remoting on components, I used React Router, and the 'history.push()' method was beneficial when I used it for my logo to go home page. </strong>
