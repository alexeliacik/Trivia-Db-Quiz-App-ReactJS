<h1 style='text-align:center;'> Trivia Db Quiz App - React JS </h1>

<strong> In this project, I used the most updated React Js futures with Styled Components; I used React Transition Group to animate when to mount or unmount something from DOM. I took data from OPEN TRIVIA DATABASE and showed users different data in different situations with beautiful animations conditionally. The project has a responsive design for all devices with the most updated CSS features. </strong>

<strong> Let's start handling data from API and Bring it ready to use. Firstly I am checking whether the user selected a category or difficulty or not. If there is no selection, questions come randomly. At the endpoint, the correct answer was separate from the wrong answers. I put it among the other answers randomly with the help of 'Math.random()' and 'splice()' methods. And then, I added 'isCorrect' and 'isSelected' values for each answer. Lastly, I created my ready to use object with a question, answers, category and difficulty values.</strong>

<strong> I provide use three lifeline chances. I want to show how I created the logic for deleting two wrong answers. I created a clone for every variable for setting the state immutable and safely. Firstly I detected wrong answers; according to their length, I deleted 2 of them with the help of 'Math.random()', 'splice()' and filter() methods and sat state. If there are fewer then three answers, I selected the correct answer right away without waiting for the user. Also, I have 'playSound()' function for playing sound after the user used lifeline chance and 'wrongAnswersDeleted' state for the styling button and making it disabled. </strong>

<strong> When I handle data from API, there was a character problem; I solved it with replace function.</strong>

<strong> I showed the user question's category and difficulty level for each question. When I took data from API, some of them had 'Category: part some of them not. I removed 'Category: ' conditionally if they have and added to all of them. Whit this technic I prevented duplication. The difficulty level had not capitalized; I made it capitalized with 'toUpperCase()' and 'slice()' methods.</strong>

<h2>CSS</h2>

<strong> For design I used 'font-size: 62.5%' technic. Because it is effortless to use and make your design responsive. Now see the picture below. </strong>

<h2>JAVASCRIPT</h2>

<strong> For remoting on components, I used React Router, and the 'history.push()' method was beneficial when I used it for my logo to go home page. </strong>
