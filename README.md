<h1 style='text-align:center;'> Trivia Db Quiz App - React JS </h1>

<strong> In this project, I used the most updated React Js futures with Styled Components; I used React Transition Group to animate when to mount or unmount something from DOM. I took data from OPEN TRIVIA DATABASE and showed users different data in different situations with beautiful animations conditionally. The project has a responsive design for all devices with the most updated CSS features. </strong>

<strong> Let's start handling data from API and Bring it ready to use. Firstly I am checking whether the user selected a category or difficulty or not. If there is no selection, questions come randomly. At the endpoint, the correct answer was separate from the wrong answers. I put it among the other answers randomly with the help of 'Math.random()' and 'splice()' methods. And then, I added 'isCorrect' and 'isSelected' values for each answer. Lastly, I created my ready to use object with a question, answers, category and difficulty values.</strong>

<h2>CSS</h2>

<strong> For design I used 'font-size: 62.5%' technic. Because it is effortless to use and make your design responsive. Now see the picture below. </strong>

<h2>JAVASCRIPT</h2>

<strong> For remoting on components, I used React Router, and the 'history.push()' method was beneficial when I used it for my logo to go home page. </strong>
